## Requirements
We recommend to download: 
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [Python 3.10.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip package manager](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py): Save the document as get-pip.py in a folder of your choice. Open the folder, type cmd into the location bar at the top of the window and tap enter. The command prompt window is opened in which you run ```python get-pip.py```. pip is now installed on your system.

After this, open a command window and install the required packages by entering ```pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scipy sammhelper odeintw tqdm```.
